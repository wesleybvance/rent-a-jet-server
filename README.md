# Bangazon E-commerce Platform

## Welcome to Bangazon!

Congratulations on completing our onboarding training! You have come a long way and gained valuable knowledge and skills. Now it's time to apply everything you have learned to a real client project: the Bangazon E-commerce Platform.

## Project Description

The Bangazon E-commerce Platform aims to provide a comprehensive online shopping experience for customers. As a team, we will be building an e-commerce platform where customers can view products, add them to their cart, place orders, manage their profiles, and much more. Our client has high expectations, and we have an exciting opportunity to deliver a top-notch solution.

## Project Planning

To ensure a successful project, we have carefully planned each phase. Our planning documentation covers all the important aspects of the project, including:

- [Detailed project requirements](./documentation/planning.md): We have documented the specific features and functionalities requested by the client. These requirements serve as our roadmap throughout the development process.

- [Tickets for Planning and Tracking](./documentation/tickets.md): We have created a set of tickets to capture the planning process and track our progress. These tickets break down the project into manageable tasks, ensuring that every aspect of the project is accounted for. By assigning and tracking these tickets, we can stay organized and monitor our progress effectively.

- [Client Feature Requirements](./documentation/client-feature-requirements.md): We have compiled a list of features that the client is asking for. These features include customer registration and authentication, product viewing and searching, shopping cart and order management, product and seller details, profile management, and product categories.

## Planning and Implementation Guidelines

We want to ensure that our project meets the client's expectations and adheres to industry best practices. Here are some important guidelines to follow:

- Comprehensive Wireframes: We have created wireframes that illustrate the user journey and interactions within the platform. These wireframes provide a visual representation of our intended user interface and guide our design and development efforts.

- Database Design (ERD): We have designed a database schema (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that maps out the relationships between different entities in our system. This ERD helps us organize and structure our data effectively.

- Project Board: Our project board serves as a central hub for planning, organizing, and tracking our progress. Each ticket represents a specific task or feature, allowing us to assign responsibilities, set milestones, and monitor our progress as we bring the Bangazon E-commerce Platform to life.

- Collaboration and Communication: We will utilize GitHub Discussion Tickets for seeking assistance, discussing project-related topics, and keeping track of our planning process. This collaborative approach ensures efficient communication and allows the team to provide guidance, support, and feedback throughout the project.

- Coding Standards: We will adhere to the Python Community's coding guidelines. This includes following consistent naming conventions, documenting classes and methods with docstrings, using proper indentation, and maintaining clean and readable code.

## Planning Process Tracking

The Senior Engineer has created a set of tickets to help you track your progress and ensure a systematic approach to the planning tasks. These tickets are designed to guide you through the essential steps of the planning process and provide checklists for tracking subtasks within each item.

To facilitate an organized workflow, it is recommended to follow the suggested order when completing the tickets:

1. [Create Project Board](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-create-project-board)
2. [Define MVP Features](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-define-mvp-features)
3. [Write ERD](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-write-erd)
4. [Create Wireframe](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-create-wireframe)
5. [Create Presentation](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-create-presentation)
6. [Submit Proposal Links](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-submit-proposal-links)
7. [Conduct Proposal Approval Meeting](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-conduct-proposal-approval-meeting)
8. [MVP Approval Checklist](./documentation/process-tickets.md#ticket-mvp-approval-checklist)

By following this order, you can build a solid foundation for the project and ensure that each step is completed in a logical sequence. Each ticket contains detailed instructions and checklists to assist you in accomplishing the necessary subtasks. Feel free to refer to the individual tickets for more information and to track your progress effectively.

## Support and Mentorship

Throughout the project, our dedicated team of senior engineers will provide guidance and support. They are here to assist you in understanding concepts, tools, and practices. While they will be working on their own projects, they will be available to review discussion tickets, provide feedback, and answer questions during designated meeting times.

## Let's Build Something Great!

Now that we have a clear plan, well-defined requirements, and the support of our senior engineers, it's time to embark on this exciting journey. Together, we will create a robust and user-friendly e-commerce platform that exceeds our client's expectations. Let's collaborate, learn from each other, and deliver an outstanding product!

Happy coding!
