# Project Planning Documentation for Bangazon Proposal Presentation

## Introduction
You have almost made it through the onboarding portion, and this is your opportunity to showcase your skills. The proposal presentation requires you to communicate your MVP for the student assessment and present the planning you have completed.

## Presentation Guidelines
- Each student will have up to 5 minutes for their proposal presentation, followed by 5 minutes for questions and discussion.
- Submit all presentation information at least 48 hours before your scheduled presentation via the provided link.
- Utilize web presentation software (e.g., Google Slides, Canva, Prezi) to create your presentation and share the links with the instructional team.
- Ensure your proposal clearly articulates the problem your project aims to solve for customers.
- Clearly explain the solution your project provides to address the identified problem.

## Proposal Planning Requirements
- Include a hyperlink to your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) accessible to instructors, along with a backup picture of your ERD in case of access issues.
- Hyperlink your wireframes, comprehensively showing the user journey through your application.
- Represent each view/page in your wireframes and provide notes or arrows describing user interactions.
- Create a project board outlining your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using tickets.

## Data Tips from Senior Engineer
During the planning phase, consider the following tips to assist with data management:
- The cart should not be represented as a table in the database. Instead, consider an open order as the cart, allowing only one order to be open at a time.
- Users will act as both sellers and customers.
- Utilize Firebase Authentication for user authentication in your application.

## Student Assessment Requirements
Ensure your project meets the following requirements:
- Utilize the backend framework taught during the course (e.g., ASP.NET, Django).
- Use the major frontend libraries and/or frameworks learned during the course (e.g., React).
- Support multiple routes to display different views to the user, allowing seamless navigation.
- Demonstrate proficiency by following the Single Responsibility Principle and writing modular code.
- Implement a form that allows users to create a new resource.
- Include select elements, radio button groups, or checkbox groups in the form to choose related resources.
- Customers should be able to delete their own data while being prevented from deleting other customers' data.
- Customers should have the ability to edit their data.
- Implement a flexible UI layout using a 3rd-party framework like Bootstrap or author your own CSS using Flexbox (optional stretch goal).

## General Requirements
Ensure your project meets the following general requirements:
- Ensure your project name is correctly specified in the `<title>` tag of the HTML head.
- Verify your project name is correct in the name property in your package.json.
- Assign the correct input types (e.g., use "number" for numeric inputs, `<textarea>` for long-form text).
- Utilize professional and relevant data throughout your application (avoid placeholders like "test" or "example").
- Remove zombie code (commented-out chunks) and console logs from your codebase.
- Ensure your Developer Tools console does not display any errors.
- Be prepared to explain any warnings that may appear in the console.
- Build a single-page application that does not refresh on page changes.
- Employ a limited color palette, left-align most text copy, and use consistent padding and margins.
- Maintain consistency in views, cards, fonts, sizes, etc.
- Resize images as necessary to display correctly in the UI, maintaining the correct aspect ratio.

Remember, this project is for a client, so make it your own while staying focused on the client's requirements. Failure to address these requirements may result in rejection by the client.
