## Ticket: MVP Approval Checklist

**Description:**
Before finalizing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Bangazon E-commerce Platform, it is essential to ensure that the project meets all the Student Assessment Requirements. Use this checklist to review your project and verify compliance with the necessary criteria.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Backend Framework: Confirm that you have used the backend framework taught during the course (e.g., ASP.NET, Django, etc.).
- [ ] Frontend Libraries/Frameworks: Verify that you have utilized the major frontend libraries and/or frameworks learned during the course (e.g., React, etc.).
- [ ] Multiple Routes: Ensure that your application supports multiple routes to display different views to the user, and users can navigate to each route/view.
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle: Demonstrate proficiency by following the Single Responsibility Principle and writing modular code where each module has a single responsibility (e.g., displaying a list of things, displaying a single thing, managing application state, etc.).
- [ ] Form for Creating Resources: Validate the presence of a form that allows users to create a new resource.
- [ ] Select, Radio, or Checkbox Group: Confirm that your form includes a `<select>` element, radio button group, or checkbox group to choose a related resource. For example, if your application allows users to create new plants for their home, one of the fields in the form should enable them to select options such as the room it will be in, the required sunlight level, and the plant type.
- [ ] User Data Deletion: Test the ability of customers to delete their own data while being prevented from deleting other customers' data.
- [ ] User Data Editing: Ensure that customers can edit their data as required.

- [ ] Warning Understanding: Demonstrate the ability to explain any warnings that appear in the console.
- [ ] Single Page Application: Ensure that your application does not refresh on page change, showcasing your understanding of building a single page application.
- [ ] Professional Commit and PR Messages: Maintain professional and meaningful commit and pull request messages throughout the project.
- [ ] Project Details:
  - [ ] Ensure your project name is in the `<title>` tag of the head.
  - [ ] Verify that your project name is correct in the name property in your package.json.
- [ ] Forms/Data:
  - [ ] Validate that all inputs have the correct type (e.g., numeric inputs should be of type number, long form text should be a textarea).
  - [ ] Ensure that all data is professional and relevant (e.g., descriptions should not be "test" or "example").
- [ ] No Zombie Code: Remove any chunks of code that are commented out, as having them in the codebase is unprofessional.
- [ ] No Console Logs: Remove any console logs from your codebase before finalizing the MVP.
- [ ] Design:
  - [ ] Implement a limited color palette in your UI design.
  - [ ] Ensure that most text copy is left-aligned for consistency.
  - [ ] Utilize proper padding and margins to enhance the visual appeal and readability of your UI.
  - [ ] Maintain consistency in views, cards, fonts, sizes, and other design elements.
